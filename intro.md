### Working with Git as a team

- **What is a merge conflict?**
- When working with git as a team you do not want to be working in the same file. When you commit and push your version of a file and then a team member does the same without pulling your version a conflict will occur.
- **How to solve a merge conflict?**
- Then you have to solve a merge conflict. To avoid this you can divide work into separate files which allows you to work together and not interfere with each others code.

### **GitHub**

GitHub is a code hosting platform made for version control and collaborating on code projects. It lets you work together with others on different projects from anywhere in the world. You need GitHub to be able to store your work in the cloud and access it from anywhere. It is a great tool and asset for developers.
