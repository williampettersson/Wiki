# wiki

This is a personal wiki documenting things I learn and useful information for myself and others.

The wiki contains: 
- [requirements](requirements.md), Tools I use for coding
- [git](git.md), which includes useful commands, faq and info about git.
- [intro](intro.md), basic markdown formatting.
